<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>re you a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com">Windows</a> user thinking about switching over to a Mac? The huge popularity of iPads and iPhones has tempted many long-time Windows devotees into confirming their place in the <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> ecosystem with a home computer that will play in harmony with their iOS phone or tablet. However, anyone thinking of making the switch has a few considerations to make beforehand — there are things about Windows that you’ll miss once they’re gone.</p>
<p>Here are the 6 things that MACs can't do but Windows PCs can.</p>

<h2>1. Gaming </h2><div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"><img src="/assets/blog-img/witcher.jpg" alt="pc gaming windows witcher 3 mac"></div><p style="width: 70%"> Windows devices can play a hell lot of games. Game developers are massively incentivized to develop their games for Windows given just how many PCs are on the market. It's in their interest to reach as many gamers as possible. After all, Macs by contrast represent only a small number of total personal computers on the market and while some developers do support their games there, but surely there's a lot less games available for the Mac overall.</p>

<h2>2. Touch Screen </h2><div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"><img src="/assets/blog-img/touch-windows.jpg" alt="windows touch screen easy"></div> <p style="width:70%"> Windows supports touch screens thanks to the developments in Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows 10 is proficient in delivering a solid touchscreen experience for tablets, convertible notebooks and desktops. Apple has still not developed a touchscreen Mac due to their decision not to include touch screen capability in OS X.</p>



<h2>3. Creating New Files  </h2><div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"><img src="/assets/blog-img/right-click.png" alt="new files right-click windows"></div> <p style="width:70%"> New files can be created with a simple right click something you’ll miss on the Mac. It is a function windows had for a very long time. Right-clicking anywhere on a Windows or a OS X desktop creates a context menu which allows you to create a new folder among other things. However on Windows you can also create new files of varying types like documents and images and compressed archives, are very handy indeed.</p>

<h2>4. Personal Voice Assistant </h2> <div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"><img src="/assets/blog-img/Cortana.jpg"></div><p style="width:70%"> Windows 10 provides a personal voice assistant. Cortana comes built into Windows 10 for search, schedule management, weather information and more. The Apple counterpart to Cortana is Siri and she's existing in iOS for many years now, still hasn't been introduced on OS X. As I'm not sure why this hasn't happened but considering how popular Cortana has become after Windows 10, Siri integration is a must for the next version of OS X.</p>

<h2>5. Streaming Xbox Games </h2><div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"><img src="/assets/blog-img/xbox-gaming-win10.jpg"></div> <p style="width:70%"> You can wirelessly stream Xbox one games. You can now stream Xbox one games from your console to your Windows PC but in addition to that you can also play multiplayer games across multiple platforms at the same time. </p>


<h2>6. Customisability </h2><div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"><img src="/assets/blog-img/gamingcomputers.jpg"></div> <p style="width:70%"> Windows PCs are far more customisable. With windows-based PC you can select multiple different brands and heavily customise the internals of your computer. Components such as CPU, RAM, hard drives and graphic cards can all be modified and upgraded on desktop PC but on a Mac upgrade potential is severely limited. In addition building your own Mac is not possible except of course if you're gonna build a Hackintosh which is not recommended, but you can build a high-end custom gaming PC rig at a very affordable price with all the components you desire.</p>




<p>So, here is my list of 6 things that MACs can't do but Windows PC can. Comment below with your own examples in the interest of fairness. Stay tuned for similar post in favour of MACs.</p>
