<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ave you ever wanted to create apps at an early age of 14 or earlier? I guess, No. All those 100 or even more lines of weird text which is called code was simply overwhelming for almost all of us.</p>

<p>Today’s world is dependent on apps in our electronic gadgets so, passion for coding needs to be encouraged among school students. Therefore to help us with that we have <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">“Scratch”</a> or <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">“MIT App Inventor”</a> like platforms. Scratch and MIT App Inventor keeps all that weird but not too difficult code behind the scenes. This make students realize that the logic behind coding apps is really simple and easy to understand. </p>

<p>In Scratch and MIT App Inventor students are presented with a plethora of boxes which has some inbuilt commands and students just have to arrange them, input some values and thats it. This makes effortless for students to grasp logics behind app development and can bring their imaginations to life. They also allow students to share their creation over internet with millions of people.</p>

<p>Scratch and MIT App Inventor has made learning to code easy which is helping school students to broaden their horizon in the field of App development. </p>
