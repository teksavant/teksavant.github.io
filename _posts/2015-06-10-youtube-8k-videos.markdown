<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap"><a href="http://www.youtube.com">Y</a></span><a href="http://www.youtube.com">outube </a>recieves 8K video playback label. Along with that a video was posted last week on June 7th. Its called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLprVF6d7Ug">Ghost Towns</a>, from user NeumannFilms.</p>

<p>Ghost Town features short looks at an abandoned mining settlement. It was shot using a RED Epic Dragon 6K camera which was then upscaled to reach 8K quality, told by NeumannFilms.</p>

<p>As per the Google's statement, the support for such a high quality was built into Youtube ever since 2010, but only earlier this year label for 8K was added to Youtube. The caveat of having such a quality on Youtube is that at the moment most of us don't have as powerful computers as required to run that content. If you happen to have such a resourse intensive computer then do checkout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLprVF6d7Ug">this high quality video</a>. Rest of us will have to satisfy ourselves with 4K or other lower resolutions.</p>

<p>We are not close to that time yet when 8K will be a common playground. There is very less devices available to output 8K video. As there are less devices so there are very little consumers for that quality. Hence content makers aren't interested in making 8K content. And due to less content consumers are least interested in upgrading their systems.</p>
