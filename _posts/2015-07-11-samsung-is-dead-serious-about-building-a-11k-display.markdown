<p class="intro" ><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile most of us are still trying to get a 4K display in our living rooms and 8K displays which are pretty much around the corner, Samsung is planning to set a significant landmark in display technology. </p>

<p>The company is planning to bring 11K display in 2018. Yes, you read it right, 11K! That’s an eye-poping 2,250 pixels per inch if the display size is 5.75” with regular 16:9 aspect ratio. A pixel density of 2250 pixels per inch is up to four times higher than that of current Quad-HD screens, which could stand at up to 576ppi depending on the screen diagonal. </p>

<p>Samsung is not the only one involved in this experiment, but 13 other companies in collaboration with South Korean government which is going to invest 26.5 million dollars over the course of five years. The project is named EnDK, and a public prototype is expected to be presented at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.</p>

<p>But a Question might arise in your mind that why are they even trying to incorporate 11k display in a smartphone when even 4K is considered overkill by many? Answer is 3D effect. Yes 3D! Reports tries to claim that if such a glorious display is used then 3D effect can be generated using some optical illusion. Or it can be concluded that such a huge amount of pixel density can fool human eyes to be looking at a 3D content.

<p>11K screens could reach our smartphones as early as 2019, and that's not it! According to Samsung Display executive Chu Hye-Yong, 11K is merely a <span style="font-weight: lighter; font-style: italic;">"basis for the Korean display industry to take another leap if related materials and parts improve through this"</span>.</p>
