<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">R</span>esearchers have created a light emitting graphene diode. Graphene is a form of carbon which is even more durable than steel and more conductive than copper. The diode works in the same way as a regular bulb’s filament.</p>

<p>Study co-author James Hone, mechanical engineer at Columbia University in New York says, <span style="font-weight: lighter; font-style: italic;">“We’ve created what is essentially the world's thinnest light bulb.”</span></p>


<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Process of Making light</p>

<p>Procedure of making light using graphene is pretty similar to that of making light in incandescent light bulb. Instead of using tungsten scientists used graphene strips a few microns across and from 6.5 to 14 microns in length, acting as a bridge to trench of silicon. An electrode is attached to each end.  Then electric current is allowed to flow through graphene which increases its temperature and emits light. Now another advantage shows up. Unlike tungsten, graphene conducts poorly at higher temperature leading to more efficient lighting in a particular  region as shown  in above picture.</p>

Study co-leader Yun Daniel Park, a professor of physics at Seoul National University, noted that graphene is usually embedded in or in contact with a substrate.<span style="font-weight: lighter; font-style: italic;">"It took us nearly five years to figure out the exact mechanism but everything (all the physics) fit. And, the project has turned out to be some kind of a Columbus' Egg,"</span> he said, referring to a legend in which Christopher Columbus challenged a group of men to make an egg stand on its end; they all failed and Columbus solved the problem by just cracking the shell at one end so that it had a flat bottom. </p>

<p>May be this is tech of future. It can help todays display technology to grow up in various number of ways. But the most prominent would be see through displays because of graphene being transparent.</p>
