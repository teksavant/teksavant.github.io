description: To know more about AMD 300 series and FURY cards 
---

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>MD finally stopped teasing PC Gamers and has released a whole plethora of Gaming GPU lineup. According to the leaks five 300 series cards were expected. But AMD also had four Fiji powered cards with HBM(High Bandwidth Memory) on-board, up its sleeves.</p>

<p>Event kicked off with least poweful cards of the bunch. AMD launched two R7 cards i.e., R7 360 and R7 370. AMD is aiming these cards for budget builds on which you would want to run poplar online games like DOTA 2 or CS:GO at 1080p on Ultra settings with 60fps.</p>

<p>R7 360 has 2GB of GDDR5 VRAM whereas 370 is more powerful and also kick up things a bit with 4GB of GDDR5 VRAM. From here starts a talk about high end GPUs, R9 series. The R9 380, R9 390 and R9 390x, all featuring full DirectX 12 support- a point that was really hammered home throughout the announcement. The R9 390 and R9 390x will expectedly feature 8GB of VRAM while the R9 380 will stick to 4GB. </p>
<p>Now here comes the most exciting stuff of the event. FURY lineup of cards. To break it down, the Fury X is AMD’s watercooled GPU, while the regular Fury will be air-cooled. Both feature 4GB of HBM memory and offer 1.5x performance per watt over the R9 290x.</p>

<p>Now for the surprise cards. AMD already has a dual GPU card in the works with two Fiji graphics cores on-board. A price was not announced but this will be available later this summer and will play a big role in AMD’s new product, currently labelled ‘Project Quantum’, which is essentially a console sized PC with a dual Fiji card slotted in for smooth 4K gaming in the living room.</p>
<p>There was one more surprise announcement in the form of AMD’s R9 Nano GPU. This is also a Fiji GPU but thanks to HBM, AMD were able to cut down on the PCB size significantly, bringing the card in line with the size of an R7 260. It offers up 2x performance per watt over the R9 290x and is cooled by just a single fan. In total, AMD has four HBM/Fiji GPUs hitting the market over the coming months.</p>
