<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">M</span>oore’s law was cooked up by Gordon Moore, founder of intel, in a paper in 1965. It states that computing power will double every two years. But in recent years it has become difficult for scientists to keep it alive due to size limitations.</p>
<p>But IBM has extended the lifespan of Moore’s Law by announcing a new chip design which is only 7nm wide. Chips like this have been tried to produce in past but never worked due to inefficiency to conduct electricity and high power demands.</p>
<p>IBM uses Silicon Germanium to process the transistors along with a new method of etching the chip dubbed extreme ultraviolet lithography. IBM says that these new processes result in a very small chip that could lead to a 50% performance and power boost over chips available on the market today. IBM has noted that its work to make this new chip <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:lighter;">"...clarifies that staying on Moore's Law is extremely difficult."</span> IBM researchers plan to work on 5nm scale in the future.</p>
