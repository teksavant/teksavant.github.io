<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here's a all new smartphone in the market serving as a debut device for the company known for its best in class music amplifiers, speaker cabinets, personal headphones and more. Yes, we are talking about a smartphone from Marshall.</p>

<p>This new Marshall smartphone running Android OS is called the London. It has two front-facing speakers and pretty unusual two headphone jacks. It is also equipped with a dedicated M button on the top of the smartphone for instant access to your music. A classic gold-accented scroll wheel on right serves as a volume control. Marshall is also touting the high-quality audio processing inside the London and is bundling a set of its Marshall Mode in-ear headphones to complete the package.</p>

<p>The Marshall London is otherwise a very conventional Android smartphone. It has a 4.7-inch, 720p display, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and an 8-megapixel camera. The battery's not huge at 2,500mAh, but it is removable, plus there's a microSD card slot for adding extra storage. But, of course, this phone isn't about the specs, it's about the music. And, well, it's about that surprisingly awesome design. The London has been priced at 4,995 Swedish krona (roughly $590) for an expected delivery of August 21st.</p>
