<p>"Sass is for developers and CSS is for web browsers." - Hampton Catlin, creator of Sass. Sass makes writing old school CSS code easy for developers as it provides a lot of features that can be used to smoothen up the web designing and development process.  Some of the prominent features are nested rules, variables, mixins, if/else statements, inheritence and more. And when you compile Sass using either a command line tool or web-framework plugin, you get well formatted CSS file. </p>

<h2>Setting up Sass on Mac</h2>
<p>Setting up Sass on Mac is pretty easy. Sass is build up using Ruby and you know what? Ruby comes pre-installed on Macs. So. all you have to do is: <ul>
	      <li>Go to terminal.app which is available in all macs.</li>
	      <li>Type in terminal: <span style="font-weight: lighter"> gem install sass</span>. And now you have sass installed on your mac.</li>
	      <li>To check the version just type:<span style="font-weight: lighter">  sass --version</span>.</li>
	   </ul>


<h2>Compiling Sass into CSS</h2>
<p>All the files for Sass are saved in .scss format and if you want your sass code to compile in CSS file then follow these steps:</p>	   <ul>
	      <li>Go to terminal.</li>
	      <li>Type in terminal:<span style="font-weight: lighter"> cd "<span style="font-style: italic">directory where your file is saved without quotes. for example: if saved in desktop then ~/Desktop </span>"</span></li>
	      <li>To compile .scss file into .css just type::<span style="font-weight: lighter"> sass file.scss</span> And a file.css will be generated in the same directory.</li>

	   </ul>
</p>
