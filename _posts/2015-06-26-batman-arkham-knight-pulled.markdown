<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>atman Arkham Knight has been one of the most anticipated game of the year 2015. It launched last week for both next gen consoles and PC. Consoles ran it pretty fine at 1080p with 30 fps but PC had a horrendous port. It was so bad that even GTX 980 had problems maintaining constant 30 fps.</p>

<p>But now Warner Bros. has acknowledged the issue and has pulled the PC version from sales. Just after launch company has released patches and told some tricks to fix performance issues but it didn't help much. Steam is showing "Mostly Negative" review status.</p>
