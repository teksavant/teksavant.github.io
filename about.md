	<p class="intro">Hi, I'm Amarjeet Singh Mudhar! I'm a Computer Science student at JIIT. </p>

	<p>I enjoy writing about things I learn, speaking about stuff I’ve experienced, and collecting experiences in general. I also enjoy using side projects to learn new things, to stay fresh, and to collect said experiences.</p>

	<p>I love coding because it reminds me of building lego as a kid (um... fine and as an adult, too).</p>

	<p>I have a wonderful family and great community and friends where I live. I'm currently living in Delhi-NCR (shoutout Ghaziabad), India.</p>

    <p>In my spare time I get distracted by a lot of things like PC Gaming, electronic music, photography, trying different cuisines and traveling.</p>

    <p>Now that you know so much about me, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40amarjeetsingh53%20Hi%20Amarjeet%21&source=webclient">you should say hi!</a></p>
